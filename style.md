* No trailing whitespace!
* Indentation is 2 spaces!
* Each property is on its own line.
* When grouping selectors, place each one on a new line.
* Opening braces are on the same line as the selector except when grouping selectors. When grouping selectors, an opening brace should be on a line by itself. There should be one space between the last character of the selector and the opening brace.
* Closing braces are on a line by themselves. Do not indent them!
* There should be a space after the colon in a property.
* Every property should have a semicolon after it, even if it's the last one.

__If someone deviates from these rules, slap him/her with a herring or another comical, pop culture fish.__
